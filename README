DFD-Yourdon-Dia-Shapes
======================

These are just a few shapes to use with Dia for creating Data Flow Diagrams. They
pretend to be as close as possible to Yourdon's notation [citation needed].

Everyone can redistribute it, modify it, sell it, eat it, punch it, ...;
copyright attribution is not neccesary indeed. Mostly the same as lecture notes.

Requirements
------------
You should have a working installation of Dia, Bash and Curl. Bash and Curl are
installed by default in Mac OS X.

Installation
------------
Download the bash script 'make-install.sh' and execute it. That will download and
install a new sheet called 'DFD Yourdon' which contains all the shapes needed to
draw a DFD diagram. You should have run Dia before trying to install these shapes.

You can try to install the shapes and sheet manually; see section 'Uninstall' for
the destination of them.

Uninstalling
------------
Delete the following files:
- ~/.dia/shapes/bubble.{png, shape}
- ~/.dia/shapes/data-store.{png, shape}
- ~/.dia/sheets/dfd-yourdon.sheet

Your previous data will be preserved and nothing else will be affected.

Discussion
----------
Mainly via twitter: hashtags #IS2 and #YouDia. Contributors are welcome.
